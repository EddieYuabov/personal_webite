            <span>Growing up, I always loved to build. <br/><br/>Whether I was constructing intricate structures in video games or creating elaborate designs with LEGO bricks, the act of building was a constant source of joy and creativity for me. This passion for creating and problem-solving naturally evolved when I discovered programming in high school. Taking my first computer science class was a pivotal moment; from day one, I was hooked. That same day, I eagerly joined the school's robotics and software engineering clubs, where I found new and exciting ways to channel my love for building into the digital realm. Since then, I have earned multiple awards, ranging from local community accolades to prestigious TSA (Technology Student Association) competition honors.</span>
            <span>I pursued my education at Queens College while simultaneously interning at Carvoy, a dynamic tech company. This experience was transformative, solidifying my commitment to programming and allowing me to refine my skills. Throughout my internship, my passion for software development deepened, and I became the <b>BEST</b> programmer I knew.</span>
